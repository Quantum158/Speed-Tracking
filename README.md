# Speed-Tracking
An Excel spreadsheet template designed to assist coaches in tracking and analyzing several athlete's performance simutaniously.
Provide without the use of VBA with the standard .xlsx file extension

# Getting Started
First, download the repository, then upon first use you will see 2 sheets Index, and (BLANK).
"Index" will contain a list of key information from all the athletes personal pages
"(BLANK)" is a template sheet

# Adding a new athlete
First, Duplicate the "(BLANK)" sheet.

Right click on the tab, Click "Move or Copy", Select a position for the sheet to appear, click "Make a copy" at the bottom of the popup, then press "OK".

Then, Make sure that a tab you just created is positioned in-between Index and (BLANK).

## Renaming Tabs
To rename an athletes page, right click on the tab you wish to edit and click "Rename". When finished, you will see the new name update in side of the spreadsheet.

## Organizing the order of name on the "Index" sheet
The index sheet grabs the order from the physical order of the tabs located between the "Index" and "(BLANK)" sheets
To change the order, simply rearrange the tabs by dragging and dropping them to a new position in the tab list (ensuring they are still positioned between "Index" and "(BLANK)").

# Usage with other spreadsheet software
This spreadsheet was designed for use with functionality provided by Excel, which may not be provided in a compatible manner elsewhere. As such, I cannot guarantee it will work with other software, including GoogleⓇ Sheets.
